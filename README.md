Guess-the-number is a Python project that I attempted to create within a time constraint of 2 hours. It features a graphical user interface built with Tkinter.

The game offers three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard. The objective is to guess a randomly generated number with the only hints being "higher" or "lower." The difficulty level determines the range of the generated number, with higher difficulties allowing for larger numbers.

After completing a game, the player's score is recorded in an XLSX file. The scoreboard can be accessed through the interface.

## Usage

Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can run the game by executing the following command:

```bash
python guess_the_number.py
```

Requirements
The project requires the following dependencies:

tkinter
xlrd
xlsxwriter
openpyxl
You can install :
```
pip install tkinter xlrd xlsxwriter openpyxl
```
